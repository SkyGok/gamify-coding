# 🎮 Code & Play – Learn by Doing

I can't learn by just **watching tutorials** or **taking notes**.
I learn by **getting my hands dirty**.

Most docs and repos feel like gibberish until I **experiment** with them.
So here’s my personal collection of **gamified, visual, hands-on websites** where you can learn coding like playing a game.
